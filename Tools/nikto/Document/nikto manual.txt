          WHAT IS NIKTO
-------------------------------------

 Purpose: Nikto is an open-source web server scanner and security assessment tool designed to identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues in web servers and web applications.

 Scanning Technique: It employs a scanning technique that involves sending HTTP requests to the target server and analyzing the responses to uncover security weaknesses, misconfigurations, and potential risks.

 Vulnerability Detection: Nikto scans for a wide range of known vulnerabilities, including outdated software versions, security headers, directory and file permissions, and common web application vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

 Database of Tests: Nikto uses a comprehensive database of tests and checks, which is regularly updated to keep up with emerging threats and vulnerabilities. This database helps Nikto identify issues in web servers and applications.

 Reporting: The tool generates detailed reports that highlight the identified vulnerabilities and potential security concerns. These reports assist security professionals and system administrators in addressing and mitigating the detected issues.

 Customization: Nikto allows users to customize scan parameters, including specifying target URLs, setting authentication credentials, and enabling or disabling specific tests, making it adaptable to different testing scenarios.

 Security Assessment: Nikto is commonly used by security professionals and penetration testers to assess the security posture of web servers and web applications, helping organizations proactively address vulnerabilities and enhance their security.
