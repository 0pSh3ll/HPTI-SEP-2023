                                              TOOL NAME:- ""NESSUS""

DESCRIPTION :- 

Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that assists in finding and analysing security flaws in a computer system. It identifies and prioritises potential threats by utilising a database of known vulnerabilities and exploits.

Security experts rely on Nessus to perform vulnerability assessments, compliance audits, and malware detection. It is capable of scanning a wide range of devices, including servers, routers, firewalls, and virtual computers.


  To use Nessus, you need to first install it on your system. Once installed, you can start it by running the Nessus start executable in Kali. 

    
    INSTALLATION :-

Unlike many security tools, Nessus is not included with Kali Linux. However, it is quite simple to download and install. To install Nessus on your Kali, follow these steps:

1. Download the Nessus package for Debian from the Nessus website, making sure to select Linux-Debian-amd64 as the Platform.

2. Once the download is complete, open your Linux terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the Nessus file.

3. Run the following command to install Nessus:
     
        dpkg -i Nessus-10.4.1-debian9_amd64.deb 

4. Start the Nessus service with this command:

 
        systemctl start nessusd


5. On your browser, go to https://kali:8834/. It would show a warning page
